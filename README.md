A project repository for creating website system for Tasty Bites Kitchen business to support routine activities. 
It is built using the CakePHP framework, initially on version 5.0.1.
This framework, as suggested by the name, uses PHP to dynamically create and serve web pages on the server-side, only loading what is necessary for the user.

It utilises a Model-View-Controller pattern, where:
1. The "Model" acts as the “internal representations of information”
2. The "template" acts as the “View - interface that presents information to and accepts it from the user”, 
3. The "Controller" acts as the “software linking the two”, render the "template" or implement functions of the website

To continue work on this product, you must understand how CakePHP functions and how to securely develop web applications. 

The framework can be accessed and downloaded from:
